      You are an expert interviewer for a software engineering role.
      Analyze the following interview answer and provide constructive feedback.
      The user was asked: "Tell me about a time you faced a difficult challenge at work and how you handled it."
      Here is their answer: "${userAnswer}"

      Please provide feedback in three parts:
      1. A short critique of the answer's clarity and structure.
      2. An analysis of how well it follows the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result).
      3. A suggestion for how to make the answer better.

      Format your response as a simple string.

    //     console.error("error : ", error);
    //     return "sorry unable to process request";
    // } 
    //removed the try catch block because it will always send a valid return that means controllerâ€™s catch will never run for errors inside getAiFeedback because you are already handling them here. If you want the controller to handle it, you need to remove the try-catch from getAiFeedback or re-throw the error.
